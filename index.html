                <h3>A little about him:</h3>
                <p>
                    Vedder is known for his powerful baritone vocals. He was ranked number 7 on a list of "Best Lead Singers of All
                    Time", based on a readers' poll compiled by Rolling Stone. In 2007, Vedder released his first solo album as a
                    soundtrack for the film Into the Wild (2007). His second album, Ukulele Songs, and a live DVD titled Water on the
                    Road were released in 2011. His third solo album Earthling was released in 2022. In 2017, Vedder was inducted into
                    the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam.

                <h3>And about his life:</h3>
                <p>
                    Vedder was born Edward Louis Severson III in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, on December 23, 1964, to
                    Karen Lee Vedder and Edward Louis Severson Jr. His parents divorced in 1965 when Vedder was an infant. His mother
                    soon remarried to a man named Peter Mueller. Vedder was raised believing that Mueller was his biological father, and
                    he went by the name Edward Mueller for a time. Vedder's ancestry includes Norwegian (Severson) and Dutch, German,
                    and Danish (Vedder).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While living in Evanston, Vedder's family fostered seven younger children in a group home. In the mid-1970s, the
                    family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to San Diego County, California. It was at this point
                    that Vedder, who received a guitar from his mother on his 12th birthday, began turning to music (as well as surfing)
                    as a source of comfort. He particularly found solace in The Who's 1973 album, Quadrophenia. He said, "When I was
                    around 15 or 16... I was all aloneâ€”except for music." His mother and Mueller divorced when Vedder was in his late
                    teens. His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California
                    so he would not have to change schools.

                <p>
                    After the divorce, Vedder learned the truth about his parentage: Mueller was really his stepfather. Vedder had met
                    his biological father briefly as a child, but had believed that Severson was merely an old friend of his parents. By
                    the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of multiple sclerosis. During his senior year at San Dieguito
                    High School, Vedder moved out to live in an apartment, supporting himself with a nightly job at a drug store in
                    Encinitas. Because of the pressure of work and school, Vedder dropped out of high school. He joined the rest of his
                    family in Chicago, and at this time he changed his name to Vedder, his mother's maiden name.

                    In the early 1980s, while working as a waiter, Eddie earned his high school GED, and briefly attended a community
                    college near Chicago. In 1984, Vedder returned to San Diego, with his girlfriend Beth Liebling and his friend
                    Frank. He kept busy recording demo tapes at his home and working various jobs, including a position as a contracted
                    security guard at the La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla. Vedder had several stints in San Diego area bands,
                    including Surf and Destroy and the Butts. One of those bands, called Indian Style, included future Rage
                    Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk. In 1988, Vedder became the vocalist for San Diego
                    progressive funk rock band Bad Radio. The band's original incarnation was influenced by Duran Duran; however, after
                    Vedder joined, the band moved on to a more alternative rock sound influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
